## This is my first blog post!

I'm going to answer the following prompts after reading the articles of data science.

What do you think being a data scientist is about?

A data scientist is supposed to help solving a real problem or participate in a project as a teammate in the real world.
A data scientist should have the basic knowledge of statistics and is good at data science: dealing with massive data using software skills.
He/she should also have some relevant knowledge of the background of the project to better collaborate with other teammates.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

Being a data scientist means he/she should have the basic knowledge of statistics while also have the skills to program codes in order to present meaningful outputs.
It's also important that he/she is familiar with the background of the projects he/she is working on, depending on which project he/she is participating in.
Being a data scientist means he/she should be capable of dealing with massive data collected and be good at solving real problems using the knowledge of statistics and the data science process that is engaging and understandable to the public.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

They are both supposed to have a certain level of knowledge about statistics and software engineering. Statisticians are better at theoratical fields, clarifying theoretical problems and providing guidence to people when they are trying to design an experiment or explore the data.
They should have solid theoretical knowledge background in statistics compared to data scientists.
However, when dealing with massive amount of data,  data scientists will have more experience and skills in software engineering to present the results nice and fast.
The means of collecting data is different: data scientists would collect massive amount of data and spend time on cleansing, transforming, etc;
while statisticians would rely on more traditional and small-scaled methods.
The modling process is different: data scientists would possibly rely on mechine learning and choose the best model, while statisticians often consider checking assumptions and improving a single model.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I think both statisticians and data scientists have their own strength and weakness, I'm glad that NCSU's statistics department has plenty of different courses that help students to improve our skills in both fields.
I won't say I'm good at statistics or data science because there are so much to learn and I'm just a grad student, but at least I learned basic knowledge of statistics and data science in NCSU,
I'm more interested in solving real problems so I'll focus on learning more about data science in the future.
