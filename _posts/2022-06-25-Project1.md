**This is my blog for ST558 Project 1.**

**explaining what you did in the project and any interesting findings**

I pull data from the pokemon API, look through the berry data and pokemon data to get an initial feeling and understandings about the data,
then I choose to do some analysis on pokemon's height and weight since in the anime they look cute so I'm wondering how their weight and height data
spread. I also bring in a variable "BMI" which is a function of height and weight.

I generated some contingency charts and plots, and I did find something interesting.

The majority of polemons have the BMI value under 10.

The pink polemons tend to be thin since none of them has a BMI greater than 10.

The gray pokemons tend to have larger BMIs comparing to pokemons with other colors.

**– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?**

I've been trying to figure out how to allow users to query for a long time, still no enough clue.

OK now I see that we aren't supposed to add interactive functions on the github page. Jesus!

The merging and modifying data structure is kind of annoying but I think I managed to do it.

**– what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?**

I'll spend more time and get started ealier since there are problems that are quite time-consuming.
