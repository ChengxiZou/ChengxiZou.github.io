Once youâ€™ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post:

explaining what you did in the project and any interesting findings

You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:

what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?

what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?

In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo and the regular repo (nongithub pages site) as well!

The URL to this (rendered) blog post is what you will submit at the project assignment link.
